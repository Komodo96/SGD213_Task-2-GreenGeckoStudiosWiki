# Project Overview
[//]: # (This section is an example structure for the proposal to your client.)

## Design
[//]: # (How will you meet the client's brief, their expectations, and their requirements.)

### Project Name
RUIN

### Description
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
The Client is looking for an FPS template that can be used for their classes. As they are strapped on time they need another team to handle the basic template for this project. The client is looking for an FPS style game in the same vein as Doom, Halo, Quake and Duke Nukem. The template should have basic enemy AI that walks around and looks at the player when in range. The player will have two guns they can switch between, be able to throw a grenade and some basic movement that inlcudes walking and jumping.

### Begin Date

01/05/25

### End Date

01/06/25

### Justification

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product in under 5 weeks
* The client has given our team freedom for how the game will feel. All values that define gameplay such as movement speed will be changeable by the client in the editor
* The game will have simple UI elements such as Health and Ammo count
* There will be a Main Menu with Start and Exit options
* The AI controlled enemies will walk around the level and look at the player. As a stretch goal they will use patrol and free roam behaviours
* How the guns behave will be customisable in the editor (Fire rate, projectile speed etc.)
* The player will be able to walk around and jump
* The player will be able to toss a Area of Effect grenade that deals damage
*  A basic menu with options like sound can be added if time permits

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* The Project will be delivered on time
* Communicate with the client on important updates
* Our team will communicate with the client when issues are encountered
* The client will be added to the project to ensure quality transparent project management
* The game does not need any finalised assets, however greyboxes will be used as placeholders for characters and weapons
* If time permits the game will have basic audio components in place

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* The UI design will be fairly basic with simple shapes being utilised 
* Health will be indicated by a bar for the player and the ammo will be indicated by numbers on the HUD
* The AI is already in the level/Spawned in?

### Schedule of Rates
Our team members hourly rate will be $30 per hour for 20 hours per week working on the project. 
As an incentive to work towards certain stretch goals we would expect a flat fee of $250 per stretch goal upon completion.
