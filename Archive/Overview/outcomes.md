# Outcomes

The outcomes to this project should be that we have a working prototype for a doom-like FPS Template that can be easily edited by the player.
more specifically, there should be the following with the creation and completion of the project:
All Weapon Functions should be modifiable through the editor.
there should be at least a main menu with a start and exit button, in addition to settings of various things, and a HUD.
a functional but very simple AI should be present with only the ability to look at the player and walk around in some capacity.
the ability to Jump in addition to being able to walk around the level.
and finally, a Grenade object that can be thrown, dealing AoE damage to enemies within the vicinity.
