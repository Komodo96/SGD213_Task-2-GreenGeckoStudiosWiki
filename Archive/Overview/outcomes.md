# Outcomes

The outcomes to this project should be that we have a working prototype for a classic FPS Template that can be easily edited by the client.
Specifically, there should be the following with the creation and completion of the project:
All Weapon Functions should be modifiable through the editor.
There should be at least a main menu with a start and exit button, in addition to settings and a HUD.
A functional but very simple AI should be present with the ability to look at the player and walk around in a patrol pattern.
The player will have the ability to Jump in addition to being able to walk around the level.
Finally, the player will have a Grenade that can be thrown, dealing AoE damage to enemies within the vicinity.
