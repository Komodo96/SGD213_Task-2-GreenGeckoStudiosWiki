# Constraints

As we are Games Programmers that are not as experienced with programming games, it is important to understand the constraints that come with them. The one that is most obvious is time constraints. The deadline of the 1st of June gives our team just under 5 weeks to work on the project. Other important considerations include the fact that our experience means that some mistakes may be present and may require additional effort, care and troubleshooting on our teams part to iron out. Some of these issues can be mitigated by peer reviewing the code to make sure it is functional and allowing sufficient amounts of time to work on important sections of the project while maintaining communication with our client and team members. Due to us not being able to work at the same time, we may need to organise weekly meetings for our team to check in with our progress and give important updates on how we will move forward tackling the project.
